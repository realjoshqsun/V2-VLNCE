## Core Highlights
🤏 $V^2$-VLNCE Benchmark Integration: Effortlessly extend any standard VLNCE benchmark to the more challenging Varied Viewpoint ($V^2$) scenario with just a few lines of code. No new datasets required. 

🧬 View-Invariant Learning (VIL): A plug-and-play post-training framework that learns sparse, viewpoint-invariant features through a novel contrastive learning objective. 

🎓 Teacher-Student Distillation: Features a specialized distillation framework for the Waypoint Predictor, where a view-dependent teacher guides a student model to maintain robust navigation under drastic camera shifts. 

🚀 State-of-the-Art Performance: Outperforms existing baselines on $V^2$-VLNCE by 8-15% in Success Rate (SR) across R2R-CE and RxR-CE, while also improving performance in standard settings
